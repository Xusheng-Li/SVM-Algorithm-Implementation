# SVM-Algorithm-Implementation
A complete implementation of Support Vector Machine from scratch, including SMO optimization, kernel functions (linear, RBF, polynomial), and multi-class strategies (One-vs-One/One-vs-Rest). Verified on classic datasets like Iris, MNIST, and CIFAR-10, with detailed performance analysis of hyperparameters (C, gamma) and comparative experiments.
