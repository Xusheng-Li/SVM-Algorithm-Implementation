# SVM-Algorithm-Implementation
A complete from-scratch implementation of Support Vector Machine (SVM), covering core mathematical foundations (maximum margin classifier derivation, Lagrangian duality) and efficient Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO) algorithm—decomposing quadratic programming into two-variable subproblems with analytical solutions, heuristic Lagrange multiplier (αi, αj) selection, and boundary case handling (αi=0 or αi=C). The repository integrates three key kernel functions (linear, Gaussian/RBF, configurable-degree polynomial) and extends binary SVM to multi-class via One-vs-One (OvO) and One-vs-Rest (OvR) strategies. Rigorously validated on classic datasets (Iris, MNIST, CIFAR-10), it includes comprehensive performance evaluations: hyperparameter (C, γ) sensitivity analysis, overfitting risk assessment, OvO/OvR time complexity comparison, and visualizations (decision boundaries, confusion matrices, misclassified samples). Additionally, it features comparative experiments with Scikit-learn’s SVM, kernel selection heuristics, SMO bottleneck analysis for high-dimensional data, plus supplementary resources (theoretical derivations, SMO pseudo-code)—serving as a comprehensive resource for learning SVM fundamentals and practical algorithm development.
